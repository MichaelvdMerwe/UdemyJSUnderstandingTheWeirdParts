b = a;
a = 3;
Pass by value
b and a have different memory locations, so when this is invoked it assigns the value to the memory space of b from the memory space of a.

b = a;
a = {};

Pass by reference
the object is stored in memory and a is pointed to that memory location, when you invoke b = a, b is assigned the same memory location as a, so they both point to the same place
