Dynamic typing:
You dont tell the engine what type of data a variable holds, it figures it out while your code is running

Static Typing:
 bool isNew = "hello" //errors

Dynamic Typing:
 var isNew = true
 isNew = "hello"
 isNew = 1
 //no errors

Primitive types in javascript:
It is a type of data that represents a single value

1. Undefined: Lack of existence(used by compiler)
2. Null: Lack of existence(used by developer)
3. Boolean: true or false
4. Number: javascript only has a floating point number, can be faked but makes math a little weird
5. String: a sequence of characters
6. Symbol: Used in ES6+
